Sri Gurindapalli Isaac Dayardhana Rao garu was a dad who actually listened to the zillion and one questions,<br>
asked by his kids.He had studied the Bachelor of Thelology and gained more aptitude, skill & knowledge<br>
to answer kids ' questions like .....

Q1) Why are little babies baptised ?
A1) Baptism means getting adopted into the family of God, to become a child of God. In 2015, the government<br>
of China had cancelled the law called - "ONE CHILD POLICY". This policy gave mandatory duty to doctors to kill<br>
the baby if she is a second baby of her parents.But if an American adopts that baby, then the baby would be saved<br>
death. The baby does not have to understand that the American is her adoptive parent now.And the baby need not<br>
feel comfortable or joyful,when her adoptive parent takes her into the safety of America, where death cannot harm her.

catch and keep the attention of the little kids.The little ones in turn thoroughly enjoyed his story-telling skills, voice modulation,songs and actions <br>

because, Mr.G.I.Dayardhana Rao garu had the talent to make even the most shy and bashful little kid to loosen up and actively take part in the <br>
class.
